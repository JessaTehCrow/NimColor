# NimColor

An easy to use module to print colors to the terminal.

This repo might see some back-end updates in the future due to this being a project for me to learn Nim, so it's not optimal nor pretty.
However, it is functioning.

## Notes

This is made solely for myself, so some functionalities might not be included.

As well as this being tested on a windows device *only*, without any extensive cross platform functionality testing being done.
Which means this may or may not function as expected on your device.
